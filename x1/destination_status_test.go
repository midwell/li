// destinationDeliveryStatus was hard-coded to activeAndWorking, so an element that had just
// told the ADMF over ReportDestinationIssue that an endpoint was unreachable answered "working"
// the moment the ADMF asked about it. Interrogation is how a provisioning function checks a
// pushed report, so the answer it will act on is the one that was wrong — and the direction of
// the error is the unsafe one: it says product is arriving when it is not.
