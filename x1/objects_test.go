// Generic Objects divide in two, and TS 103 221-1 divides them, so this element does too.
//
// GetAllGenericObjectDetails sits in clause 6.4.1's unqualified "The following requests and
// responses shall be supported", alongside the other seven interrogation messages, and its
// response has an answer for an element in our position: the object list "May be omitted if
// Generic Objects are not supported by the NE". The six object CRUD messages of clause 6.8 are
// qualified — DeleteAllObjects "shall be supported *if* the implementation supports Generic
// Objects", and an element that cannot store an object "shall reject the CreateObjectRequest
// with an appropriate error response".
//
// So the query is answered and the CRUD is refused. The two tests below pin each half, because
// each has a plausible wrong answer: refusing the query fails a mandatory message, and
// answering the CRUD claims a capability this element does not have.

// TestGenericObjectQueryIsAnsweredWithoutClaimingSupport covers the half that is easy to get
// backwards — answering must not amount to claiming support.
