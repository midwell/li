// This is the audit that should have found the last two defects, run by a test instead of
// by someone reading the schema.
//
// The class it catches: `encoding/xml` silently discards an element a struct does not
// declare. On this interface that is not a parsing detail — `listOfServiceTypes` was
// unmodelled, so a task narrowing interception to particular service types was
// acknowledged with the narrowing thrown away, and the provisioning function had no
// channel through which the divergence could have been reported. Two of these have now
// been found by hand, each after the code had been reviewed. The third should be found
// here.
//
// It is not the same check as TestRenderedResponsesValidate. That one validates what this
// element *emits* against the published schema, which says nothing about what it fails to
// *read*.
//
// The distinction that makes it work, and that a first pass at this audit got wrong: an
// unmodelled `xs:choice` arm is a refusal, because a value in an arm nothing maps falls
// through to "unsupported" and the message is rejected. An unmodelled `xs:sequence`
// element is a silent discard. Conflating them reported DeliveryAddress's three
// deliberately-unsupported arms as three defects.
