// report and no operator action it would prompt. Half of that holds: a shutting-down
// element's report may well not arrive. The other half does not — a pool is also closed by a
// reconfiguration, where the ADMF is reachable and this is simply product the element
// produced and did not deliver — and the shape of the mistake is the one this whole plane
// keeps making: deciding on the caller's behalf that nobody wants to be told. onDrop is the
// POI's own hook, it is the hook that already means "product was lost, not a destination
// fault", and what a POI does with it during teardown is the POI's business.

// an address: which destination is failing belongs to that destination's own status, not to
// the element's, and a probe is the one place that distinction is easy to lose.

// failed and whose warrant was then withdrawn would otherwise count for the life of the

// tasking at all would report itself faulty. That is the probe-stuck-on failure this design
// exists to avoid, and it is answered by asking only about destinations still in use.

// A destination nothing has been sent to is not counted either way — see Client.Unreachable —

// once: two warrants to one agency are one place product goes, and counting it twice would
// make "2 of 2 unreachable" out of a single failing endpoint.
