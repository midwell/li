// Conditional attribute types, ETSI TS 103 221-2 table 5.3.1-2.
//
// TRANSCRIBED FROM V1.10.1 (2026-03). Restate the revision whenever this list is
// extended, for the reason payloadFormatRules carries the same stamp: a stale
// transcription and a current one look identical without one.
//
// Only the six this project emits are named. The table defines 22, and
// CONFORMANCE.md in this directory carries the disposition of every one of them —
// for the sixteen that are absent, the reason is the part worth reading.
//
// Which interface owes which is 3GPP TS 33.128's to say, not this specification's:
// clause 5.3 makes every attribute conditional "as directed by the relevant LI
// architecture". Table 5.3.1-2 of TS 33.128 requires NFID and IPID on both X2 and
// X3; table 5.3.2-2 adds Timestamp, Sequence Number and the two target identifiers
// for an xIRI; table 5.3.3-2 requires Timestamp and Sequence Number for an xCC and
// requires neither target identifier.

// identifier the element already asserts on X1, so that the identity a mediation
// function receives is the one the provisioning function tasks.

// per PDU, which on X3 means per packet.

// The context is not the connection. The clause numbers PDUs "with the same XID,

// Unsigned is what the clause says, so these eight octets carry every instant from
// 1970 to 2106. The clause's own NOTE — that timestamps after 2038 cannot be
// encoded — reads the field as signed, which it is not, so there is nothing here to
// design around. An instant outside that window (a zero time.Time, say) encodes to
// a wrong one rather than to an error; the caller passes a clock reading.
//
// This function timestamps nothing itself, deliberately. What belongs here is the
// time the *event* occurred on X2 (TS 33.128 table 5.3.2-2) and the time the xCC was
// generated on X3 (table 5.3.3-2). Those differ whenever a record is built after the
// fact, and a mediation function cannot tell which one it was given — so sampling
// the clock in here would quietly convert the first into the second.
//
// The nanosecond field carries whatever resolution the clock offered, unrounded. The
// six-digit rule that governs X1's textual timestamps is a rendering rule for a
// different interface; applying it here would discard precision for nothing.
