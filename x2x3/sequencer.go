// Sequencer hands out the Sequence Number conditional attribute's values for one
// interface, in the scope ETSI TS 103 221-2 clause 5.3.9 defines: the number "shall
// start at zero and increment by one for each X2/X3 PDU with the same XID, DID,
// NFID, IPID and Correlation ID context", a separate sequence is kept for X2 and X3
// within one context, and the sequence restarts at zero once the four-octet field is
// exhausted.
//
// This element sends no DID, and its NFID and IPID are constant for the life of a
// process, so the part of that key which varies is (XID, Correlation ID) — which is
// what this indexes. Two consequences are worth stating because the obvious
// implementations get them wrong:
//
//   - It is not per connection. One PDU delivered to two of a task's destinations
//     carries one number, because the number belongs to the context and not to
//     either socket. A counter held on a Client or an AsyncSender would instead
//     number unrelated contexts from one sequence — and the keepalive mechanism,
//     which does count per connection, needs its own counter for exactly that
//     reason: a Keepalive PDU zeroes the XID and Correlation ID, so its context is
//     not any task's.
//   - One Sequencer per point of interception is one sequence per interface, since
//     each POI here delivers on X2 or on X3 and never both. That is why no interface
//     discriminator appears in the key.
//
// Safe for concurrent use: the number is taken on the path that frames a PDU, which
// in the UPF is four workers deep.
